Dad left in the mornin', far away
Mom took me to the field, out to play. 
Run again, run again, allie allie oh,
The night is lighter than the darkest day. 

Mom yelped like a dog, sure as I'm born
she pricked her finger on a dark, long thorn.
Run again, run again, allie allie oh, 
her blood flowed and watered the corn.

Dad says mom can never come home. 
She's got the [[plague of flowers]], blood and bone.
Run again, run again, allie allie oh, 
Mom got to dad and now I'm all alone. 

[[Plague of flowers]] both, through the forest they come. 
"Come back, sweet daughter, let's have some fun!"
Run again, run again, allie allie oh, 
My legs are tired and I'll never see the sun.
