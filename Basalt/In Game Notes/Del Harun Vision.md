The resulting celebration was one of color and music. The fires were built high, the flames licking toward the heavens. Frantic fiddle music surged through the camp and the [[Del Harun]] people took toward frenzy, swirling dances around the fire. Their silks moved in hypnotic patterns and you could not help but wonder if there was some truth to their claim that you all live in a dream.

Their priest, a man wearing an orange and scarlet cloak with strands of colored fabric braided into his beard, introduced himself as [[Manek]] (_Pronounced Muh Neck_). He tells you more of the Dream Realm, called the Dahlen. There are true dreams and there are false dreams. Within their tribe, the Del Harun can be held accountable in the waking world for their actions in dreams, though it is up to him to determine of the dream is true or false. He invites you into the dream realm, offering you a purpleish, somewhat chunky liquid that he promises brings true dreams of wisdom. He smiles when he says it. 

Obviously, you decide to partake. It tastes somewhat spoiled and alcoholic, like a kombucha mixed with old orange juice and a spot of sour milk. Manek laughs at the face you make after the first swallow. Your body relaxes and your mind beings to feel soft and limber. The colors around you seem more vivid and faces seem to appear in the flames, fragments of memories that you're not sure belong to you. You begin to hear hidden melodies within the music and are delighted as if you found a secret that was only for you.

Somewhere within the joy and chaos of the celebration, you have a vague memory of falling asleep.

You are young and so is [[Ahaan]]. You were meant to be cleaning the prayer room in-between lessons but instead, you've drug Ahaan down to the catacombs beneath the temple. You are not meant to be here- it is a place they store artifacts and the venerated dead. Only those high up in the clergy are meant to enter this dusty, forgotten place. Ahaan is nervous as you lead the way, a low, sputtering torch in your hand casting the only light, burning away any cobwebs it comes in contact with. 

"[[Laidren]], we should go back. [[Sharad]] will whip us if he finds out what we've done. Turn around, brother."

But you didn't care. Sharad was a doddering old priest and you were the son of [[Rajani]], one of the richest merchants in Ravensport. What power did he truly have over you? Plus, his age did not allow him to swing the switch very fast at all. [[Muzri]], on the other hand... she could swing that birch sapling with the power of all the devils in the 100 hells. 

You stopped suddenly, staring at a moth eaten red curtain hanging for a doorway. It must have been quite nice once. It billowed slightly, as if a slight breeze came from the chamber beyond it. A great sense of curiosity gnawed at your heart. You could feel yourself being called into the chamber. 

"We should leave it alone, Laidren. This is forbidden to us! and... it's cold down here, I want to go back to the prayer room."

Your hand was moving aside the curtain before he was finished speaking. You waved your torch a few times, the sudden influx of oxygen feeding the flames, causing it to burn brighter. Your mouth gaped open at what you saw.

The walls were lined with tapestries depicting dragons. Dead dragons. The sun hung over their bodies in each one, a halo around it. At the forefront stood a stone statue of a warrior in resplendent armor holding a long lance. The carvings upon it were incredibly ornate and beautiful, though there was something cruel about his face. You could feel an aura of power emanate from it. At it's base sat a large chest of beautiful walnut with brass inlay and support. It almost seemed to be pulsating...

Some far away rational part of your brain knew that Sharad was to come now, though he had been dead fifteen years. You could remember the whipping he gave you, but you did not care- your mind could only think about that chamber as he brought the switch down again and again.

But that isn't happening. Instead, the chest is opening. Something was coming out of it. This wasn't how it had happened.

"I told you we should have turned back."

You turn to look at Ahaan, but he isn't there. You stumble backwards toward the curtain, but there is no doorway behind it, only hard rock. The figure in the chest has reached it's full, towering height. It is a corpse holding a long, resplendent lance and you have no doubt that it is the man from the statue in front of you. 

You also know it is your brother. It is strange how dreams work like that. 

You can not scream nor run. All you can do is stand there as the man thrusts the lance forward, skewering you through the sternum with a sickening crunch. You can feel yourself getting weak as your knees buckle. You stare up into the killers eye's; your brother's eyes. They have become a reflective pool, showing you a glimpse of yourself. 

Strangely, you are not the young Laidren. You are instead the dragon you know as [[Nathnondoroth|Viscous]].

And you are dying.

Your mouth is dry and your head throbs. It feels like someone scooped out your brain and replaced it with wet paper towels. Judging from the temperature and your hunger, it is late morning. Your not sure whose tent you are in or how you got here. All you can think about is food and water. You can make sense of your visions later.
