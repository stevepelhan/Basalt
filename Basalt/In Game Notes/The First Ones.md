_"... When Basalt broke with the primordial realms, there were great quakes and massive volcanos rose up from the depths. It was an era of chaos. The realm remade itself daily, only to tear itself asunder by the evening. The severance from the primordial realms gave the world form, but the effects of chaos still ran over the land like and endless sea. Where a mountain arose, it would shatter and crumble into the sea. Dark mists covered the sky, obscuring the heavens._Â 

It was in the heavens that life first began. While the world below was in turmoil and fought itself to be formed, the first points of light began to wink into existance. Long before the sun, the stars of the night sky began to light the realm above. They existed along the boarder of our world, touching both the primordial realms and the void. At the nexus of chaos and nothingness, they formed to watch the realm take shape. The elder fae were birthed of everything and nothing, and it would be their childer that first lived on the world of [[Basalt]].
