Death to father elf! Joy to mother darkness!

For a year, I suffered strange visions while I slumbered. The others at the temple called me mad! There was a realm of ice and endless cold. Hairless, grey skinned beings peered out from within the ice that encased them, staring endlessly forward, though their eyes were only inky black pools. At night, I would spend an eternity in this place, only to awaken again in the morn. There was only a voice to keep me company during these endless vigils - the voice of the one called [[Kina]]. 

She whispered to me, telling me many terrible and dark secrets. She told me of the half-men that battled the elder fae at the beginning of time. Hers is a world of primordial chaos. She is a volcano, an earthquake. She is needless death and the crumbling of empires. She is everything and she worried that nothing would come. 

So it was that the voices told me to come to the swamp so that I may hear her clearer, and hear her I have. She tells me of the great war to come, when the primordial chaos will rage against the void. She tells me of the year of skulls and that she awaits the servant who will usher it in. Could it be me? I spend countless hours transcribing her words into the [[Bone Book]]. It will be the relic that brings her holy age and destroys the flower of nothing. 

She will bring about the end of the age of elf and human, leaving only the wicked holy mother. Here shall I do her bidding, until the Year of Skulls begins.
