## Description
Archmage found in [[Brachmoore Fortress]]. Was doing [[Wasog]]'s bidding in exchange for his left. Didn't truly fear [[Wasog]] himself, but the [[Ogre Sisters]] kept him in check. Appears to be affiliated with the [[Red Robes]], although he at one point wore [[White Robes]].

## History
Was captured by [[Wasog]] while he was investigating the [[Plague of Flowers]] several years ago and as such saw [[Wasog]]'s rise to power.

## Notes
Friendly enough to answer our questions about the [[Plague of Flowers]] but did not want our assistance in escaping, believing that he would be able to take care of himself now that the [[Ogre Sisters]] were out of the way.
