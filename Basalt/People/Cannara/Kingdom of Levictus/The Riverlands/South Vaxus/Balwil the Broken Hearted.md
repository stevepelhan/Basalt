## History


## Notes
Found dagger and missing page in his room. Pointed to him being [[Sarlen]]'s murderer and a partial motive.
Upon unraveling the mystery, he seems to mostly be strung along due only to his love of his extravagate lifestyle and his willingness to do almost anything to keep that going, including murder. Remainded to [[Davich]] to corroborate the story and evidence and for magical rehibilitation.
