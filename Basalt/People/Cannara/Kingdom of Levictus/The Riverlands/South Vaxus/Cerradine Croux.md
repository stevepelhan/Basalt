## History
While his love of the arts was true, he had overextended himself, as shown by his house being in disrepair. In an effort to restore his status, he had begun trying to revive [[Zivbry]] in an attempt to use his power to further his own goals.

## Notes
Admitted to the whole scheme several times.
Ordered [[Scratches]] and his guards to kill us
Sentencing and execution carried out extrajudicially. Had to trim the fat, so to speak.
