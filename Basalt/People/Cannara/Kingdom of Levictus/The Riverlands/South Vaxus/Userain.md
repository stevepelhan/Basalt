## Description
Ancient [[Munin]]. In order to get revenge she summoned [[Zivbry]] but it didn't go well.

## History
Userain was broken. Her hate dissipated in the screams of her kindred. Regret washed over her like a deep ocean, drowning her anger in remorse. She had found the price she was unwilling to pay for her vengeance. 

It took every spell she had to get close to the demon. She had not managed to harm the beast, only to slow it. There was no hope that her skill would avail in this contest. Userain was not a fool, however. She had prepared for this eventuality. The dagger in her hand was forged of metal and enchanted with her strongest magics. 

If the massive claws of the beast had not killed her, the eldritch backlash would have. She sacrificed her body to pierce the heart of the demon with her blade. It’s life energy flowed into the dagger, the vessel the wizard had created. The roars of [[Zivbry]] were heard from miles away. It was the last sound that Userain would hear. 

She was unable to kill the demon, however. It was too powerful for that. Her sacrifice only enabled her to trap it’s soul. It’s body lay limp amidst her scattered remains. No Munin remained. The monstrosity had taken its toll.

 Her followers agreed to hide the knife in the farthest reaches of Basalt where none may ever find it again. Many prayers are offered that they did an adequate job. Should the knife ever be reunited with the demon’s body, no hope for the living shall remain.
