## Description
Golden dragonborn from the same clan as [[Relrash]]. Presumed dead, but found alive as a prisoner in [[Tor Towig]].

## History
Lived as a part of [[Relrash]]'s clan, but not as a fighter. Was kidnapped as part of the raid on [[Relrash]]'s home by [[Grazzen Gortu]]. Was used by the [[Ogre Alliance]] to take care of the [[Golden Dragon Egg]] as they used it in their rituals to create corrupted dragonborn.

## Notes
Seems somewhat suspicious after being found. We left him in [[Tor Towig]] to ensure that the civilians don't betray us, either on purpose or not.
