## History


## Notes
Found dead on a boat just off the docks. Last seen were two men using the old smuggling tunnles by River's Welcome which lead to the docks.
Apparently uncovered research that reuniting the dagger [[Userain]] used to kill [[Zivbry]] would bring Zivbry back to life and was killed to prevent that knowledge from coming out.
[[Cerradine Croux]] ordered his murder which was performed by [[Scratches]] while [[Balwil the Broken Hearted]] held him down.
