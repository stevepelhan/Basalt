## Intro
Learning to cook is an unending endeavor. You're never finished. Like a good cheese, it evolves and matures over time. And like a good cheese, if you're not growing and maturing, you're rotting. 

Though, that can mean different things to different people. My father, for example, spent all his time slaving away in the kitchens, while I joyfully watched and helped my grandmother. He would scour the tiny market in [[Places/Cannara/Kingdom of Levictus/The Riverlands/Blankshire]], while I travelled [[Cannara]] with my mother. He poured over tomes in the library searching for recipes, while I spoke with strangers around the campfire.

While his cooking improved, my whole person improved. While he remains a chef, I've taken my talents to the Justicars. While, like a brisket, he is stuck in the stall, I've broken through and been forged anew in the fires of {townName}.

My father is a chef, and while I cook, I am so much more. Matured by my travels, tempered by my tribulations, and empowered by my new ally, I've taken it upon myself to expand my Justicar charter. While my colleagues apply their skills within the confines of the law, I've begun to take matters into my own hands, extrajudically. After all, you can't make an omelete without breaking a few eggs, and, as we all know, learning to cook is an unending endeavor.

## History
Grew up in [[Places/Cannara/Kingdom of Levictus/The Riverlands/Blankshire]] where [[Cahirub's Father|his father]] was a chef for a local lord. [[Hamala|His Mother]] would take him traveling to [[Dane Caelen]] to visit [[Ridwyn|his grandmother]] and those trips instilled a joy of travel, meeting friends on the road, and cooking.

Those trips also led to a natural wanderlust. The joy of finding new people and new dishes drove him for many years and his natural affiability led him to mediate several disputes amongst the people that shared his table. Turns out that he was good at it. So good in fact that a [[Justicars|Justicar]] travelling incognito observed him and offered him an invitation into the order.

Who knew that many [[Justicars]] employ similar strategies for their work. Some  tell stories or perform. Some freely mend clothing. But the best ones all use their passions as a way to get their subjects to let down their barriers and share freely. And that's how Cahirub spent the last few decades. Roaming around [[The Riverlands]], learning the lands and the people, finding new exciting ingredients and dishes to make, and working to bring justice to the people.

That was, until [[Blackreed]]. He had spent decades getting to know [[Blackreed]] and its people only to see it all destroyed in one night. Cahirub saw the fires from his camp, but by the time he arrived it was too late. For the first time he knew I had to right this wrong myself, but when Cahirub caught up to the raiders, he found nothing but an abattoir. The raiders lay slaughted around a single dying human. He was too far gone to speak, but his sword was not. It told Cahirub that warrior's story and awoke something awful in Cahirub.

Now, he travels the lands, on the surface, performing his duty, but when necessary, taking justice into his own hands.
