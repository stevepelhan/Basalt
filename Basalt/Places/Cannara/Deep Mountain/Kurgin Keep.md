When war broke out between the humans and elves, the Dwarves hastily mobilized and constructed a monument to their building prowess- Kurgin Keep. With armies clamoring to move through "Kurgin Pass" (known by the humans as Skulgar Pass), they Dwarves wanted to protect any forceful incursions into their homeland. In truth, neither side of the conflict had the power to contend with the other and dealing with the very well entrenched Dwarves. Instead, Kurgin Keep became the world's most fortified toll booth. Both sides paid money to the Dwarves to peacefully move through the pass. Those that didn't found the massive gates of Kurgin closed and were forced to contend with the harsh conditions that could arise there.Â 

There are many today who are bitter over the Dwarves war profiteering, which has created a bountiful economy for them that exists to this day. The soldiers of clan Kurgin now hire themselves out as guards and mercenaries, as there hasn't been reason to heavily guard this post in a long while.
