Many settlements may have an herbalist or a simple hedge mage that the people call upon. When a wizard wishes to obtain true power, however, they are required to attend three tower. First, they will be tested to see if they're worthy. Many applicants do not survive the test. If they do, then they pledge themselves to one of the three orders- the [[white robes]] (good aligned wizards) the [[red robes]] (neutral aligned wizards), or the [[black robes]] (evil aligned wizards.)

Wizards who do not pledge themselves to one of these three orders are known as the [[brown robes]] - renegades that are to be killed on sight. The elves pay no attention to any of this nonsense, however- they have their own magical traditions.
