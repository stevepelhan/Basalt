## Description
Bridgeton is a quaint village located right where the river splits. It's often referred to as a "bard's paradise", as the many river side inns host performances of all kinds, constantly competing with each other for audience. There is ample boat traffic that passes the village and rowdy sailors pack into the taverns nightly. Farther away from the water lives the general populace and Bridgeton looks like any other small village. Many of them resent the constant stream of outsiders passing through their village, but the tourism is so entwined with the economy of the village that none complain too loudly.
