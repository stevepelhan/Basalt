## Description
North Vaxus (or, according to their citizens, just "Vaxus") is overseen by lord Bensen Octavius the third. His grandfather, the original Octavius, was the commander of the Skin and Bone mercenary company, a decorated unit of soldiers from over the seas. As a reward for his help in the Elven wars, he was made lord of North Vaxus.Â 

His son (Bensen Jr.) continued to uphold the martial tradition, drilling the Skin and Bone company and keeping them a fit fighting unit. They were knight's feared in all the land. Since being thrown from a horse and becoming paralyzed some 20 years past, his son (Bensen the third) took over. There are many in the company that are third generation fighters at this point. Unfortunately, Bensen the third has left the honor of the company falter, and they have turned to less noble pursuits...
