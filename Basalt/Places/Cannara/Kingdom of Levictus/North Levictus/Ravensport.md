## Description
Ravensport is the shining jewel of the [[Kingdom of Levictus]]. The capital city has a thriving port and trade from the east brings much gold into its coffers. Despite being in a human kingdom, the city is quite metropolitan. Ships from [[Hillhold]], crewed by dwarves, routinely bring dwarven goods for gold and lumber. Gnomes have their own neighborhoods that stretch back generations. Elves, while not near as common, can also be found here. They have an embassy in the Tower of Dawn with a small population of the sylvan folk settled nearby.
