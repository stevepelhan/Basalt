Crissis is a god of the space between boundaries, transition, cycles, and time. He has various aspects that are celebrated, but all things are thought to be in his domain. Life is ever changing and in flux and thus is in his realm. As change is such a core tenant of his teachings, his will is ultimately unknowable, but his disciples see his workings anywhere in turmoil or in the boundaries (dusk and dawn, bridges over a river, city walls, the first day of a new month, etc.)

Not a dragon
