Continued to purge [[Turnadin Tower]]. Discovered several magic items in [[Morgan Middenheap]]'s room included a [Cloak of the Bat](<[Cloak of the Bat](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Items:Cloak%20of%20the%20Bat#content)>). Found a teleportation circle which several warlocks escaped using. Did not destroy. [[Aelar]] learned the sigil's. Portal existed into [[Shadowfell]] that I dispelled. 

Additionally, found 3 "mirrors" that seemed to offer lines of communication to the various leaders of the [[Ogre Alliance]]. Destroyed the mirrors and striped them for gold.

Tried to take a long rest but a gate was opened overnight. [[Aelar]] was able to banish several of the creatures that came through while I dispelled the gate and we dispatched the remaining demon. We successfully rested afterwards.

This morning I began the process of Hallowing the tower while [[Aelar]] and [[Relrash]] go outside to speak to [[Nathnondoroth]].
