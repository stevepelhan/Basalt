After defeating the Giants we celebrate with the [[Del Harun]]. Several of us partake in some mystical dream juice given to us by the Del Harun priest [[Manek]]. I have visions of [[Ahaan]].
Hoot saw [[Munit]] [[Grunhold]] [[Lord of Ash]] [[Gardener]]
[[Aelar]] saw the apocalypse. [[Kina]] believes she can't stop [[The World Ender]] but will create an empire of death.
[[Fonkin]] did not partake, but saw a shooting star and several stars in the sky wink out.

After waking, we took three [[Del Harun]] riders with us to get to the [[Chasm of Sorrow]]. On the way, we were confronted by blackguards. They were clearly set by the [[Ogre Alliance]] to find us.

The [[Del Harun]] leave us at the [[Chasm of Sorrow]]. We cross the chasm with the power of friendship and make it to [[Wyneryth Tower]].
