[[Cahirub]] enters [[South Vaxus]] just as the rest of the group finished killing some imps. Spoke with [[Thydain Bloodsausage]] to gather more information about [[Sarlen]]'s death. [[Balwil the Broken Hearted]] has not returned since the rest of the party looted his room. The dagger and torn out page implicate him greatly. We confirmed the key found in Balwil's room opened the shed in the back. Spoke with [[Cerradine Croux]] and [[Scratches]] about Balwil. Found a hidden message in the town wall used to send notes and moved on to [[Feather Mound]].

Found the crypt of [[Userain]] and [[Zivbry]]. Userain's crypt held an enchanted urn that tried to fill us with rage and [[Zivbry]]'s was chained shut and guarded by an illusion. Upon leaving we encountered [[Ulenas]] trying to enter the crypt. He must have seen us and tried to run, but we caught up to him. [[Burt Cokain]] talked him off the ledge and he told us he had been conscripted by [[Cerradine Croux]] to find the crypt then use the dagger to "kill" Zivbry. Apparently Cerradine had lied to [[Ulenas]] and killed [[Sarlen]] to hide the truth of what would happen when the dagger reunited with Zivbry's body.

Tried to catch [[Balwil the Broken Hearted]] returning to his room but we were too late. Instead, confronted [[Cerradine Croux]] at his house and got him to admit to ordering the murder, which was performed by [[Scratches]] and [[Balwil the Broken Hearted]]. [[Cerradine Croux]] tried to have his men kill us and nearly succeeded with [[Phan]]. After dispatching [[Scratches]] and the other guards we confronted [[Cerradine Croux]] once more where he admited to the whole scheme. He intended to try and control the demon to enrich himself regardless of the outcome and we dealt with him directly. [[Balwil the Broken Hearted]] we handed over to [[Davich]] after he admitted his part in the conspiracy.
