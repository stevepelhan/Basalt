We find ourselves just entering the top floor of [[Wyneryth Tower]]. In one room we find an Ogre that we had seen before in [[Lunkton]]. We pretended we were with [[Morgan Middenheap]] and he quickly tried to pretend to be on her side.

After moving to a new room, I was swept up in a vision by [[Kina]]. She appeared larger than ever before. Either as though she was a giant all along, or she grew due to acquiring new power. She told me she's already sweeping over [[The Moon Lands]] and that the mountains won't keep her back from the [[Kingdom of Levictus]]. She tried to convince me to become her champion and threatened my family. I told her to fuck off.

We continued downward in the tower and encountered a demon, imps, and the Hag sister. We killed her and found an emissary from Kina. After killing the emissary we returned to the mirrors to talk to the [[Witch of Brachmoore]] and [[Wasog]]. The Witch sent some corrupted dragonborn to attack us which we dispatched.

We rested in a hut with our eyes on the magic circle, but no more monsters passed through. While resting we identified several magic items:
[[Magic Items|Staff of Withering]]
[[Magic Items|Ring of the Ram]]
[[Magic Items|Scarab of Protection]]
[[Magic Items|Flame Tongue Longsword]]
