Awoke in [[Wyneryth Tower]] to a feeling a dread. Left quickly and communed with [[Crissis]]. Spoke with [[Parsis Firehammer]] via sending stones. Apparently [[Waterbottom]] is quarantined.

We hallowed [[Wyneryth Tower]] and teleported back to [[Turnadin Tower]]. Spoke briefly with [[Ahaan]] and moved on to [[The Brackenwood]].

We felt some impending doom and have used sending to [[Parsis Firehammer]], [[Talon Oldscribe]], [[Rajani]], and [[Nathnondoroth]] and communed with [[Crissis]] but got little information.

Ran into some plant monsters on the way to [[The Brackenwood]] and killed them. Found [[The Brackenwood]] and spoke to the trees. The believed that there was an enchantment in place that would prevent us from finding the tower, but we all know that [[Crissis]] would not suffer that. I cast find the path to show us the way to the tower. On the way we ran into some monsters that blocked our path and made me drop my concentration.
