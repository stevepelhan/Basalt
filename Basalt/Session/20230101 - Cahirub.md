Bought another horse to carry [[The B-Team]] around and rolled on to [[Places/Cannara/Kingdom of Levictus/The Riverlands/Blankshire]]. Went straight to [[Vigir]]'s place for a few reaons. First, I like it there. He's friendly, he lets me cook, and he knows what's going on in the town. Second, [[Wasat]] is looking for the [[Glade of Thorns]] and if anyone would know about it, it's Vigir. Finally, [[Charlotte]] is some sort of emissary and wants to arrange a meeting with [[Headmaster Grutten]]. Vigir, as usual, takes good care of us when we arrived and chats while I prepare some food. A new urchin of his named [[Rose]] helps him out. He mentions that [[Mikil]] was recently found in a field surrounded by slaughtered goats and the Headmaster has been waiting for a [[Justicars]] to help sort it out. Lastly, he mentions that if we want to know anything more about the [[Glade of Thorns]], the best person to talk to would be [[Latislav]] in [[Braven]]. But unfortunately it seems like [[Braven]] was completely depopulated due to a merfolk raid recently. Vigir gives us directions to [[Latislav]]'s house nonetheless in the hopes that we can find some glues to either his or the Glade's whereabouts.

[[Wasat]] bought [[Copper]] a drink in the bar after he stared at him longingly. Apparently Copper was found 6 months ago thought to be dead and woke up in the middle of his wake. He believes that something in [[Greymurk Swamp]] brought him back to life. [[Places/Cannara/Kingdom of Levictus/The Riverlands/Blankshire]] also had an issue where the dead weren't staying dead but a band of adventures cleared it up (this was the [[Sword of Crissis]] group before [[Laidren]] joined).

In the morning we had over to the Headmaster's place. I spoke with [[Mikil]] privately to get his side of the story. Apparently a small redheaded mullet child lured him into the woods and when he finally came to he was in the farmer's field surrounded by the dead goats. The child asked him where the white rose was. [[Mikil]] doesn't see it, but it seems like an obvious reference to [[Rose]] and her white hair. He's worried his story sounds crazy, but given what we've learned of this town in only 1 day I'd say it checks out.

[[Wasat]], [[Phann]], and myself investigate the area where [[Mikil]] initially passed out and find some sort of ashy dust in the area while [[Charlotte]] and [[Burt Cokain]] speak with [[Rose]]. She has very little memory of events before the [[Sword of Crissis]] group passed through, and apparently this is the second time she's had a memory slip like this. Something is clearly going on with her.

We convince [[Burt Cokain]] to inhale some of the dust and he immediately starts hallucinating in exactly the same way that [[Mikil]] describes.

Out of leads, we head into [[Greymurk Swamp]]. [[Wasat]] overhears some friends arguing about missing chickens and finds some sort of stilt-like tracks heading back into the swamp. We borrow a boat and head deeper into the swamp, occassionally following the sound of some chickens. Finally we find a dungeon going into the swamp.

In the dungeon we encounter some mushroom like creatures that can cause us to hallucinate. I briefly fall under their spell before we dispatch them. In the dungeon we come across a strange altar and an open portal that goes to a dark, cold realm with elvish markings on it ([[Kina]]). Possbily related to the rumors of dark elves previously having settled here. We also find some barricaded off sections with draconic writing on them that none of us can read.
