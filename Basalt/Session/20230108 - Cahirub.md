We continue our exploration of the dungeon in [[Greymurk Swamp]] and dispatch more of the mushrooms. While taking a long rest, [[Wasat]] catches some mushrooms spying on us, but we don't find them. We find some strange purple plant that [[Cahirub|I]] take a cutting from for minty freshness. We try to move beyond the draconic barricades and find some kobolds hiding in the shadows. I try to offer them some food but spring a trap and they immediately attack. Their sorcerer gets away and their leader tries to take [[Phan]] captive but [[Wasat]] is able to heal him and he gets away and we kill the leader.
