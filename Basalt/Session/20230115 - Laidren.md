Began the session by recasting Find the Path to have [[Crissis]] guide us to [[Brachmoore]] and [[Tor Towig]]. Very shortly on we encountered 3 wraith bears. [[Laidren|I]] beseeched [[Crissis]] to banish the bears and he heard my prayers. As we progressed, several starving specters rose from the ground to attack us. I was able to turn 5 of them and force them to flee as we dispatched the rest. Finally we came across the village of [[Brachmoore]].

We took a long rest before trying to pierce our way through the village to the tower. In the morning we tried to approach but noticed that this village was not like the rest of the towers and was obviously prepared for our coming. Armed guards man the watch towers, ballista line the windows, and well oiled patrols move about the village.

With a little luck, we made our way through the town and subdued the one guard that spotted us and made our way to [[Tor Towig]].

Successfully used divine intervention on this day to banish three wraith bears (day 18 on the counter).
