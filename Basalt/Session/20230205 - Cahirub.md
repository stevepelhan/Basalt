Traveled by boat up to [[Murkwater]]. [[Charlotte]] spoke with the [[Headmaster Wallaces]] while [[Wasat]] and [[Cahirub]] visited with [[Thessa]]. Discovered rumors of [[Blankshire]] raiding fish caravans coming from [[Murkwater]].

Posed as traders and joined a fish caravan to [[Blankshire]] and were beset upon by bandits. Turns out that they had been legitimately by [[Headmaster Grutten]], but with the goal of patrolling the trade route and safeguarding the caravans but the leader of the group had taken it upon himself to resort to banditry to earn some extra gold.

We remanded the group to [[Headmaster Grutten]] and he slated the leader for execution and the rest of the group for conscription and went to [[Murkwater]] to apologize and sort out the incident.

From there we traveled alone to [[Braven]] where we found some changelings masquerading as [[Latislav]] that tried to attack us. Their leader intervened and stopped the fight. Found clues related to finding the [[Glade of Thorns]] buried in the deris of [[Latislav]]'s house. It seems like the changelings were seeking the same thing.

We left before they could learn that we had pocketed the clues and we following the clues to a series of waystones. The stones lead us toward the coast, up through [[Blackreed]] and finally to the [[Glade of Thorns]].
