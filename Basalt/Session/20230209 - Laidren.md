Spoke with [[Mier]], a golden dragonborn captive in [[Tor Towig]] and continued to clear the rest of the tower. Awoke a golem but prevented some evil skeleton from entering the tower through a portal. Also found [[Turdok]]'s resting place and spiked him. Found several magic items in [[Turdok]]'s room.

We barred the door to [[Tor Towig]] and spoke with the staff and [[Mier]]. It appears that the [[Red Mistress]] was largely left to her own devices and it's unlikely anyone will bother us in the tower.

We rested the rest of the night and let [[Turdok]] greet the dawn. While the day progressed, we planned how best to try and deal with Wasog.

At dusk, [[Fonkin]] set off to light some distracting fires and the rest of the group attempted to sneak over to [[Brachmoore Fortress]] to try and infiltrate the tower, but unfortunately we were spotted by several dragons.
