Begun with the battle against three red dragons. Two young, and 1 Adult.

[[Laidren]], [[Aelar]], and [[Kagamekhar]] decided to face tank the dragons breath and took gobs of damage, but we were able to best them and send their remains back to the [[forge of twilight]].

We scared off a roving patrol, and debating moving forward in the chaos or retreating for the time being.

We pressed on and used locate creature to find [[Wasog]] and stone shape to burrow through the walls of the fortress right to his bedroom where he was cowering. He tried to flee but [[Relrash]] tackled him and betwen him and [[Aelar]] they managed to kill him while everyone else fought off his henchmen.

[[Wasog]] is down, but not totally dead, and we remain in the midst of the keep at the end of the session.
