At the [[Glade of Thorns]] we met [[Maelthron]], a druid that [[Wasat]] has been told to find. He told us that [[Kina]] represents death and the [[Plague of Flowers]] represents chaos. Apparently these two dangers represent two of the three prophesied catasophes that are predicted to befall [[Basalt]]. [[Maelthron]] believes it's strange that the two are happening at the same time, but thankfully it's only two.

[[Maelthron]] told us that [[Cannara]] came from a seed in the cosmos and that the [[Glade of Thorns]] was created by the elder ones to make sure it won't perish. It's where the solutions grow to the prophesied dangers, although those resources are finite. [[Maelthron]] gave us a [[Finnest]] and the following advice, "If you wish to stop [[Kina|the goddess of death]], it must be planted where the sun never shines in the [[Valley of Night]] beside a spring of blackwater to nurture it." He told us that we must find a [[Silver Shovel]] fashioned from the world tree believed to be under the palace in [[Dane Caelen]].

[[Rose]] is the solution to the [[Plague of Flowers]] according to [[Maelthron]]. She is a key to realms beyound.

From there we returned to [[South Vaxus]] where [[Davich]] put us up. We left in the morning but got stuck behind the constript army. We met their leader, [[Zikmond Brozik]]. [[Revan]] enlists an urchine named [[Ferd]] to help run messages and whatnot.

[[Zikmond Brozik]] is helped by his brother, and alleged goat fucker, [[Pasha Brozik]].

[[Burt Cokain]] writes a song to commemorate the occasion called [[Songs by Burt|Horny Bill]], about Horny Bill who lives in a field of eggs.

In the morning, we set off to leave before the column, but quickly find evidence of a dead sentry named [[Nermal]] and a potential ambush. We were able to defeat the ambush and follow the tracks back to a larger encampment that we defeated as well, except for one member that turned invisible and ran way. We plan to follow next session.
