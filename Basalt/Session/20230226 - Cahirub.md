We were able to track and capture the dragonborn abomination that had escaped. We showed it to [[Zikmond Brozik]] and continued with them to [[Ravensport]].

In [[Ravensport]] several of us went to [[Shiv's]] while [[Revan]] went to speak with the leaders of [[Ravensport]]. [[Phan]] found a fan to buy him drinks for the night while him and Wasat hung out with [[Pasha Brozik]]. [[Burt Cokain]] sang a song and spoke with the current owner, [[Shiv's owner]].

[[Revan]] returned in the morning with horses for everyone and we headed out.

On the way to [[Skulgar Keep]] we fought a two-headed giant. Once there we met [[Lord Meruitus Coralian]], the leader of [[Skulgar Keep]]. [[Phan]] performed some heroics to woo the people and engender good will while [[Burt Cokain]] sang [[Songs by Burt|Grandma's night with the Bears]], a song about how [[Pasha Brozik]] definitely didn't fuck a goat.

After leaving, we heard cries for help and found [[Fluticus Flam]] nearly falling off a cliff. We continued on to [[Kurgin Keep]] and were allowed inside with our weapons but requested to speed the night in quarantine. Awoke to an apparition leaving our room and our door unlocked.
