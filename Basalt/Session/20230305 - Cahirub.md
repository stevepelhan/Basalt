Picked up at [[Kurgin Keep]] on lockdown with an apparition of [[Phan's Father]] leaving our room. [[Wasat]] turned into a mouse to follow the apparition but found more bloody footprints. The footprints ended in a room with a high elf (not [[Phan's Father]]) who looked like a fighter of sorts. He was locked in another cell. [[Revan]] messaged him with a cantrip. He told [[Revan]] that he “failed” [[Phan's Father]] and that the elven cities had fallen to [[Kina]]. His name is [[Zygarian]] who [[Phan]] recognized as the guard of the royal family. He was fleeing elven lands and was captured by the dwarves. We also learned:
* The leader here is named [[Lord Hafrok]]
* They have released a few prisoners
* [[Zygarian]] killed three dwarven guards before getting captured

We took a long rest and spoke with [[Lord Hafrok]] in the morning. He warned us that passage to the elven lands was dangerous due to the war but negotiated the release of [[Zygarian]] for 55gp. [[Cahirub]] cooked a feast.

[[Zygarian]] told us of a way to get under the castle and the dwarves escorted us to the west until we cleared the mountains. From there we traveled north to [[Iron Loch]] and went to the town pub, [[Iron Loch|Lil’ Barley’s]]. The patriarch of the town was missing. He wandered down into the old mine a week ago and has not been seen since. According to rumor, he said that a god whispered to him that there were riches in the mountain so he has been attempting to mine there for the past year. He became obsessed. There is no formal reward offered for his safe return. He was relatively well-liked.

We went to the mine, called "?". We fought some creatures with big evil beards and found the leader of [[Iron Loch]]. He rewarded us with a well appointed manor in [[Iron Loch]]. [[Phan]] found a groupie to manage it for us while we traveled.

We left for [[Dane Caelen]] and on the way heard shouts coming from the forest near [[Ilendorei]]. Upon arriving we found a group of undead attacking the town.
