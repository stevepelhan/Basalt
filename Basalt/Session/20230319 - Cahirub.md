We continued the combat in [[Ilendorei]] and defeated the undead horde. They were very grateful and  shared what little they had with us. [[Burt Cokain]] played a new song called [[Songs by Burt|Only Phan's Wild Justicar]], to put the people of [[Ilendorei]] at ease.

We spoke with the current town leader, [[Mael Devfy]], and convinced the town to flee to [[Iron Loch]].

We continued on to the [[Gaping Hole]] outside of [[Dane Caelen]] and defeated the undead guarding the hole. Once inside the hole, we fought some strange bugs, some of which [[Burt Cokain]] was able to charm.
