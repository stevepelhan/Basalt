Continued to fight against [[Wasog]]. He actually crit a death save and got back up but we were able to kill him.

We continued to investigate the 3rd floor of [[Brachmoore Fortress]] and found several [[Gideonites]], some Ogres, and met [[Naaejor Crimsonspell]]. He told us of his research including how [[Wasog]] rose to power, more about the [[Plague of Flowers]], and how he was captured and trapped by the [[Ogre Sisters]].

[[Naaejor Crimsonspell]] told us how [[Wasog]] communicated with [[The World Ender]] through dreams and that he even met the [[Lord of Ash]].

The [[Lord of Ash]] is somewhere in [[The Southlands]]. He is the prophet of [[The World Ender]]. He works to bring about the end of all things.

There is a large tree in [[The Southlands]]. [[The World Ender]] is there at the top of the tree.

[[The World Ender]] and [[Kina]] are at odds. Both want the end of the world, but in different ways.

Met the [[Bard Twins]] and freed them. They are going to write a song of our exploits.

[[Naaejor Crimsonspell]] and the other [[Gideonites]] told us that no one patrols on this level and [[Wasog]] only allows his most trusted advisors and guards here, so we gathered all of the non-combatants up and rested.

In the morning we went to the roof and cleared the Wyverns and Ogre handlers there. We plan to continue searching [[Brachmoore Fortress]] as [[Naaejor Crimsonspell]] told us that [[Wasog]] had a lot of treasure squirreled away.
