Begun the session finishing up a fight outside of [[Wasog's Harem]]'s room. After defeating the guards we spoke to the Harem. Many were grateful, some confused, and some upset. We rounded everyone up and sent the upstairs with the various other non-combatants.

After, we moved down to the first floor. We easily intimidated some random guards who told us where their commanders were. We tried to clear the area while avoiding unnecessary fights. This means that many of the dragon abominations did not attack us, so we left them be. We found some Ogre stablemen who gave us intel on [[Brachmoore Fortress]] including the current floor and additional subfloors we have yet to visit. Additionally one of them mentioned that the [[Red Mistress]] visited them in a dream and seemed to indicate that she was attempted to return via the crypts in the floors below us.

We found the commanders and convinced them that [[Wasog]] was dead and that [[Wasog's Queen]] was making a play for the throne through us. They've agreed to bar the doors while we continue our coup d'Ã©tat.

We moved on the the first sub-floor without fulling clearing the ground floor, trusting to the guards and commanders behind us. On the first sub floor we defeated several mages, but have much more to explore.

Current team goals involve finding and killing the [[Red Mistress]] if she still haunts this plane, searching for [[Wasog]]'s stash of magic items, and finding the teleportation circle below. If we can eliminate [[Wasog's Queen]] along the way, all the better.
