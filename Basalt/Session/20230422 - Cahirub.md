**Steve was absent for this session**

[[Burt Cokain]] convinced the spiders and other creatures not to eat us because we are diseased and chalk full of toxins. We also persuaded them that the god of the undead may see them if they do not help us. They told us about a new stone “gate” that might be the reason that the undead are digging. They did not know much about it. One of them named [[Dave]] leads us to the tunnel and communicates to other creatures along the way not to attack us.

We came across a spider that was using a green gem as bait in a trap. [[Wasat]] used magic to steal the gem without triggering the trap. [[Dave]] leads us to a trap. We promptly killed [[Dave]] and fought our way out of the trap. [[Revan]] got pissed off that someone attacked her, so she took him alive and cut off all his arms and legs and dragged him around with a rope the rest of the day.

We came across a half spider/dark elf and asked for safe passage; she granted it. We find the stone gate, which we learned blocks the way to the city. We cannot open the gate, so we knock on it. A peep hole opens with an elf on the other side that recognizes [[Phan|Prince Phan]]. He opens the gate and reveals a hastily made underground encampment.

We learn that survivors (high elves, wild elves, and gnomes) from [[Dane Caelen]] regrouped here, which is a minority of the citizens and called the settlement [[Dane Below]]. To make things worse, many more have died underground from attacks by the creatures. [[Phan's Father]], the king, and the first-born son ([[Phan's Older Brother]]) were left behind in the city. His mother, [[Beala]], is in the encampment and is safe. She gives us a key to open up a [[Door of Relics]] under the city, which may contain the magic shovel we seek in addition to other artifacts.  

They have been here for a month. They are deciding on a plan for next steps in two days. She asked [[Phan]] to stay and rule with her and have another go in his stead on the quest to find the shovel. He agreed to consider it. The survivors argue about next steps. High elves want to seek refuge with the dwarves. Other groups want to stay in the encampment (half the gnomes) and other groups want to return to the city and fight (other half of the gnomes, [[Bobblefat]]’s faction).

The newly elected leader of the wild elves is [[Mebra Moonshadow]]. She will mediate the discussion among faction leaders regarding next steps that is scheduled for two days later. She feels that whatever they decide, it is most important to unify as one.

We leveled up at the end of the session.
