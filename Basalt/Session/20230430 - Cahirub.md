Opened in [[Dane Below]]. [[Phan]] "comforts" his followers and has a night at the tavern contemplating his decisions. [[Cahirub]] searches for his family and finds [[Ridwyn]], his grandmother, and [[Hamala]], his mother. Both are alive, but [[Hamala]] is had suffered some sort of fit, and is non-verbal and not super response. The fit seems to have started at the same time that the events of [[Blackreed]] took place. [[Wasat]] goes to speak to the gnomes, [[Bobblefat]] and [[Mipplewise]]. [[Revan]] goes to see if any of her order is in the settlement. She finds one and learns much about [[Kina]] and her previous attempts to take over the world. Apparently she has [[Kina's Children|7 children]] fathered by [[Parf Edhell]]. [[Wasat]] continues by speaking to the members of his order that survived. After the encounter he realizes that one of them felt very cold to the touch and worries she may be undead. The next day [[Cahirub]] and [[Wasat]] return to talk with the [[Shadows]]. While we can't trap them in a lie we are further convinced that they are undead. [[Wasat]] shadows the main one while [[Cahirub]] follows the other two. The main one takes [[Wasat]] and [[Revan]] to a secluded locations and tries to kill them, but they stop it. [[Cahirub]] tails the other two to the quarantine area where they pass through. He quickly intimidates the guard into letting him enter and follows the druids around as they pretend to adminster aid to the infected. Quickly it becomes apparent that they are spreading an undead plague and trying to convert the [[Dane Caelen Refugees]] to undead to overthrow the remaining survivors. [[Cahirub]] tries to run and warn the others but he is unable to find them and returns to try to ensure the undead are unable to cross back into the main area. A battle ensures and [[Cahirub]] does his best by himself, but is unable to beat back the horde. He's saved only by the timely arrival of [[The B-Team]]. During the batle, one of the undead shadow creatures refered to [[Cahirub]] as a Son of [[Agas]], a likely reference to his unknown warlock patron.
