We follow a lead about [[Zygarian]] having last been seen in the quarantine area. After several hours of investigation we spot a staircase leading down to the grounds below. We tie a rope and let ourselves down and begin our descent. We have only 6 hours before we need to return to [[Dane Below]] for the meeting to decide its future. On the stairs we find [[Burt Cokain]] and encounter several hordes of undead and werebats. [[Burt Cokain]] sings us some new songs during the descent including [[Songs by Burt|Big Foot Phan]], and [[Songs by Burt|Grandma Revan's Deep Dark Cave]]. 

We end the session having spent 40 minutes travelling and an hour in short rest, leaving 4 hrs and 20 minutes remaining before we want to return to [[Dane Below]].
