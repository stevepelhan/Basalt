We continue downward on [[The Bottomless Stairs of Dane Below]] and encounter several more enemies. We find a statue of [[Kina]] with a gold crown that we leave for our return up. Further down we find [[Zygarian]] enthralled by a statue. [[Phan]] attempts to walk up to him and suffers some serious psychic damage. We're able to bring him away from the statue it he comes back to himself. It seems he was enchanted to come down here and doesn't display any other signs of being enchanted/infected/turned. Further on, we encounter a Ghoul named [[Carak]] guarding the path forward. He tells us that [[Agas]] was a child of [[Kina]] before being cast out. Rather than attack, we elect to return to [[Dane Below]] for the council meeting.

We have the settlement post guards at the stairs and do some investigation while we wait and learn that [[Kina]]'s 7 children rose up and tried to over throw her but ultimately lose. The folklore is that she banished them and threw them down into the realm of man, but no sign of them exists. Stories are conflicting on their motivations for their rebellion, with some saying they wanted her power and other speculating that they knew her end game and didn't want to die for her cause.

At the council meeting, everyone except ~~[[Mebra Moonshadow]]~~ expressed a desire to flee, while she wanted to stay here. [[Revan]] was able to probe her mind and discover she was corrupted by [[Kina]]. ~~[[Mebra Moonshadow]]~~ turned into a bloated ghoul and attacked us.

After we defeat ~~[[Mebra Moonshadow]]~~, [[Beala]] makes one last plea and they all agree to flea to [[Iron Loch]]. We anticipate it will take several days before they can mobilize and depart and  [[The B-Team]] moves on to look for the [[Silver Shovel]] in [[The Dane Caelen Crypts]].

We arrive in the crypts and find a well/looking glass. After making a wisdom save, it prompts us for a question, which is seems to answer with visions. [[Revan]] asks the pool what it is and sees visions of her order's past, [[Phan]] sees [[Wasat]]'s old mentor injured by a tree, and [[Cahirub]] asks after [[Agas]] and sees the following:

"A star falls from the heavens, streaking across the sky. An impact! Dust is thrown up from the ground, mud spatters in this swamp. Something glows in the crater. Pulsates. It's... a sword. A great sword..."

This appears to confirm that his secret patron is indeed [[Agas]], banished from [[Kina]]'s realm.

We move on and encounter a tentacle monster and several burning ghouls that we dispatch.
