We continue investigating [[The Dane Caelen Crypts]]. We notice thumping from some of the coffins and investigate, finding zombies. It appears that most corpses have been reanimated. Some remain in their coffins but others have moved somewhere, although we haven't yet figured out where.

We move into a new area that has a mirror where only [[Cahirub]] can see a figure moving in it. He has pale skin, dirty dark hair, slightly larger than [[Cahirub]] in every way. When [[Cahirub]] looked away for a second the figure was gone.

In a nave like area, we encountered a creature of shadows made up of all of the elves that were slaughtered during the holocaust at [[Dane Caelen]] which we put to rest.

Moving into a final area, we encounter some more undead clearly searching for something and their leader. We are able to defeat them even after they got reinforcements, but do not have time to investigate the pit of aberrant and likely necrotic energy in the middle of the room.
