[[The B-Team]] continued exploring [[The Dane Caelen Crypts]]. We investigated the green swirling miasma in the middle of the room we started in and were confronted with undead guardians of the [[Door of Relics]]. With [[Phan]]'s appearance, they were forthcoming with information about how to open the vaults and access the [[Silver Shovel]] within. We used the key that [[Beala]] gave us which reset the portal and allowed us to travel within.

Inside, we found a number of magic items:

Once out, we were beset upon by more undead, but he guardians came to our aid. We elected to spend some time to search for [[Phan]]'s father and brother. We encountered and defeated a vampire, and [[Wasat]] was able to borrow a warming gem from a fire elemental without being seen.
