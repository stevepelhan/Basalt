We continue investigating [[The Dane Caelen Crypts]] and eventually find [[Phan's Father]], although he seems very much the worse for wear. We are able to finish exploring [[The Dane Caelen Crypts]], even finding the path to [[Dane Caelen]], and back track to where we had left some refugees. However, the seem to have somehow added numbers to their ranks. [[Cahirub]] investigates the mirror and discovers the word "betrayal" scrawled all over the room with the mirror, but only visible in its reflection. He then drags the mirror to where the rest of the team is discussing with [[Phan's Father]] and the refugees about what is going on. When looking through the mirror [[Cahirub]] can see that it is [[Zygarian]] that has betrayed us, and he shifts into [[Lazaz]], the head changling from [[Braven]]. Many of the refugees also shift into their true forms and a battle begins.

[[Lazaz]] destroys us handily and runs off with the pack, but we manage not to die and to kill the rest of the changelings, or at least all of the ones that showed themselves. Now we are forced to plan our next move.
