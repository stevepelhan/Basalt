## Welcome to Steve's DND Notes


## [[Basalt]]
The homebrew setting for all of our current campaigns. Composed of two main continents. [[Cannara]], which is divided into [[The Moon Lands|The Elven Moon Lands]], [[Deep Mountains|The Dwarven Deep Mountains]], and the [[Kingdom of Levictus|Human, Gnomish, and Halfing Kingdom of Levictus]], and [[Grunkit]], which is largely populated by the [[Ogre Alliance]], the [[Gideonites]], and Minotaurs.

## [[Sword of Crissis]]
The main group running around [[Basalt]]. [[Laidren]] sees this group as representing the Sword of [[Crissis]] aspect and calls them this accordingly. Responsbile for restarting the [[forge of twilight]], preventing a [[Kina|Kinan]] death cult from attacking [[Dane Lyvial]], exposing [[Zinna]] as a hag, destroying all three "grandmothers" of the [[Ogre Alliance]] and hallowing [[Turnadin Tower]] and [[Wyneryth Tower]].

## [[The B-Team]]
Secondary group operating independently in [[Basalt]] played by the same people. Have currently preventing a demon summoning in [[South Vaxus]], proved the innocence of [[Mikil]] in [[Blankshire]], and found the [[Glade of Thorns]].
