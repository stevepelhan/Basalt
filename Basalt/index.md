## Welcome to Steve's DND Notes


## [[Basalt]]
The homebrew setting for all of our current campaigns. Composed of two main continents. [[Cannara]], which is divided into [[The Moon Lands|The Elven Moon Lands]], [[Deep Mountains|The Dwarven Deep Mountains]], and the [[Kingdom of Levictus|Human, Gnomish, and Halfing Kingdom of Levictus]], and [[Grunkit]], which is largely populated by the [[Ogre Alliance]], the [[Gideonites]], and Minotaurs.

## [[Sword of Crissis]]
The main group running around [[Basalt]]. [[Laidren]] sees this group as representing the Sword of [[Crissis]] aspect and calls them this accordingly. Responsebile for restarting the [[forge of twilight]], preventing a [[Kina|Kinan]] death cult from attacking [[Dane Lyvial]], exposing [[Zinna]] as a hag, destroying all three "grandmothers" of the [[Ogre Alliance]] and hallowing [[Turnadin Tower]] and [[Wyneryth Tower]]. Recently defeated [[Wasog]] and learned how the [[Ogre Alliance]] came to be connected with the [[Plague of Flowers]]. Will likely move on to [[The Southlands]] soon following a lead that [[The World Ender]] and his prophet the [[Lord of Ash]] are there.

## [[The B-Team]]
Secondary group operating independently in [[Basalt]] played by the same people. Have currently prevented a demon summoning in [[South Vaxus]], proved the innocence of [[Mikil]] in [[Blankshire]], and found the [[Glade of Thorns]].
The team has recently learned of a way to stop [[Kina]] and is en route to [[Dane Caelen]] to acquire the [[Silver Shovel]].
