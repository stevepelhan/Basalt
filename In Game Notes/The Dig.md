"The High King has once again demanded that we dig deeper. This has become an obsession for him now to the detriment of all other work. Our forges grow cold and even our important work of chronicling our history begins to suffer as he pulls more and more of our members to help in the efforts. There is a dark irony that he has decided to do this burrowing under the Guild of Kings, as if the institution of our government has become as unstable as the halls that birth it.Â 

Brethus Holylight has been imprisoned for speaking out against this project. The priest claims that it is the same compulsion that causes the Dark Elves to live far underneath the sun lit lands that now drives our king. She believes there is some dark force that lives far within the world in a cold, desolate place that even the heat of our forges could not warm. Perhaps she is indeed a mad woman or perhaps our High King wishes to silence the truth. "
