The Elves are close to the truth of it - they are descended from stars. The fae were the first ones, the first beings. They are the driving force behind creation, a mixture of chaos and joy. The elves were birthed from the stars, but stripped of their fae nature. Fae are the antithesis of the [[plague of flowers]]. Only creation can fight the void.
