[[Laidren]]'s younger brother.

## History
While Laidren was the first born and favored, Ahaan was always brighter, faster. While Laidren partied and ignored his studies, Ahaan focused.

## Notes
Ahaan stole the [[Bones of St Bernice the Dragonslayer]] from the [[Crissis|Crissian]] church, supposedly at the behest of Crissis. This act precipitated Laidren to finally get off his ass and heed his own visions.
First caught wind of him in [[Hillhold]] when we freed some dwarves that had been captured by the Ogre raiders.
Finally caught up to him in [[Turnadin Tower]]. [[Morgan Middenheap]] stole his face and posed as him. Discovered the ruse and freed him. Restored his face.
