## Description
Totally not a demon child. Small orphan child that lives at [[Vigir]]'s. Was lost in the swamp at some point and had no memory of what occurred before that. Apparently this is the second time something like that has happened.

[[Mikil]] mentioned that during his hallucinations a small child asked him where the White Rose is which seems like a reference to her.

## History
Had some interaction with the [[Sword of Crissis]] pre-[[Laidren]]. Unclear exactly what happened, but she has no memory of her time before that.
