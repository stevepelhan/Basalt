## History
Seems to hang around [[Feather Mound]] digging for relics and other items to sell. Not strictly illegal but certainly dangerous.

## Notes
Doesn't like people much
A little slow
Found him entering [[Zivbry]] and [[Userain]]'s tomb and spoke with him. Apparently he believed that using the dagger on the demon would finally kill it and not bring it back to life as [[Sarlen]]'s research showed. Looks like [[Cerradine Croux]] and crew were using him as an unwitting pawn. After talking he agreed to our plan to try and lure them out. The plan ultimately didn't work, but recommended no charges.
