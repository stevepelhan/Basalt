The Draketeeth mountains are home of the Dwarves, both above and below ground. The mountain range has protected them from both the Western Elves and the Eastern humans and they have happily led a mostly isolated life. Kurgin pass is the only reliable way through the mountains - at least that outsiders know of. There are rumors of Dwarven tunnels running miles upon miles underneath the mountains.
