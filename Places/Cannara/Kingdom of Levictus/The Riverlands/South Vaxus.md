# Description
South Vaxus lays where the Hag's Blood river splits in the North Riverlands. The villagefolk are distrustful of outsiders and prefer to keep to themselves. A representative from Ravensport makes a trek to the village quarterly to collect taxes and inspect the local militia, but otherwise the Kingdom leaves them alone.
