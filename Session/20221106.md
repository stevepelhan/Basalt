We woke up outside the tower and questioned [[Ahaan]]. Connected several clues (scar on face, faceless man in dungeon) and got confirmation from Crissis that it was actually [[Morgan Middenheap]] wearing Ahaan's face. Confronted her by cursing her then killing her. She tried to planeshift away and [[Aelar]] counterspelled her allowing us to finish her off. 

Had to return to [[Turnadin Tower]] to free the real Ahhan. We were confronted by some dragon abominations. Found [[Ahaan]] and cured him and reattached his face. He mentioned, and [[Nathnondoroth]] confirmed, that they somehow needed the [[Bones of St Bernice the Dragonslayer]] to create those dragon abominations. Spoke with [[Nathnondoroth]] and decided to free her. Began purging the rest of the tower.
