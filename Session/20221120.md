[[Aelar]] and [[Relrash]] spoke with [[Nathnondoroth]]. I finished hallowing [[Turnadin Tower]] and used word of recall on it.

[[Laidren]] used the teleportation circle to return to the [[forge of twilight]]. Spoke to the [[Crissis]] church to get supplies and people to help defend the tower and potentially spread the Church. [[Ahaan]] appears to be doing a good job managing the tower. Luckly, refugees from [[Duron]] found the tower with expertise in farming, adminitrastion, and defense.

Left [[Turnadin Tower]] to travel to [[Wyneryth Tower]] and try to kill the next hag there. In the [[Planes of Dreaming]], we met the [[Del Harun]] people led by [[Chieftan Heskin]].

Were attacked by Giants while meeting with the [[Del Harun]].
