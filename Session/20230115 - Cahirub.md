After his surrender, we spoke with the Kobold leader enough to get the full story of what happened with [[Mikil]]. While he was drugged by the mushrooms, the kobolds attacked the sheep and ate them, running away when they heard people approaching. You'd think the farmers would have seen the tracks and this whole mess could have been avoided, but no. Fortunately the Kobold leader forfeited his horde as restitution for the stolen goats and as we had no proof that they had killed anyway, the group wanted to let them go. Obivously I object and I'm sure this will come back to bite us in the ass, but alas. Next time I will try to be more persuasive.

We returned to [[Blankshire]] and planned our next move. [[Charlotte]] has business in [[Murkwater]]. Something about preparing for an undead horde and some long night or whatever. [[Wasat]] is interested in investigating the deserted town of [[Braven]] and following up on his lead about the historian [[Latislav]] that once lived there and what he may have known of the [[Glade of Thorns]].
