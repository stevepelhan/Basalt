One long rest since Divine Intervention

Took shelter in an abandoned house as close to [[Tor Towig]] as possible to devise our plan. Decided on having [[Fonkin]] and [[Hoot]] stealth the the tower and climb up, while [[Aelar]] rested in the bag of holding and [[Laidren|I]] flew him to the top of the tower. Both [[Hoot]] and [[Laidren|myself]] used potions of invisibility to help us ascend stealthily.

At the top of [[Tor Towig]] the [[Red Mistress]] was in the midst of some foul ritual but immediately spotted me even through my invisibility. I dumped [[Aelar]] out of the bag and he vortex warped [[Kaz]] and [[Relrash]] to the top.

Unfortunately, it seems in her desperation, the [[Red Mistress]] has switched alliances and joined with [[Kina]] instead of the [[Plague of Flowers]]. While we were able to banish some of her allies, the Bone Lord was not so easily defeated. Nevertheless, we persisted and managed to defeat her.

We will need to continue investigating the tower and potentially the fortress for more clues to the [[Plague of Flowers]] and whether in switching alliances the threat has been nullified or not as well as to tie up any loose ends with regards to the [[Ogre Alliance]].
