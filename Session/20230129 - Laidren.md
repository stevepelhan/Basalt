Continued exploring the rest of [[Tor Towig]]. Found another reference to the [[Mysterious Note]]. Additionally found the [[Decaying Journal]] and a brief explanation of how to defeat [[Turdok]].

Discovered [[Turdok]] performing a ritual on [[Relrash|Relrash's]] Golden Dragon Egg using the [[Bones of St Bernice the Dragonslayer]] to somehow profane the egg and harness its power to create dragon like abominations. Defeated [[Turdok]] but were unable to truly kill him. We saw his mist form descend into the depths of the tower and with the new knowledge of how to truly kill him we tried to follow him.

We were able to clear out the 2nd floor of the tower which was mainly a barracks of sorts. Found a maid and a captured dragonborn.
